I found my inspiration for the project watching a Youtube video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF2F0YIgxy4
which highlights the following project:
https://github.com/tomobones/dictcc_wrapper/.

Although not intended, this project may be quite similar, due to similar goals.
Therefore, it is ment to be purely seen as a learning experience.

Testing was done using John Brewers MinUnit
(see https://jera.com/techinfo/jtns/jtn002 for further info).
